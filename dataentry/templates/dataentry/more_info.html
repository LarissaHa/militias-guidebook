A Catalogue of Pro-government Militias Worldwide between 1981-2014
<br>
<br>
<h4>Sources</h4><br>

This guidebook uses a wide range of sources to catalogue pro-government militias (PGMs). <b>Academic research</b>, 
human rights reports and open-source encyclopedias are systematically evaluated. We searched for scholarly 
articles that are published in peer-reviewed journals through the Web of Science, but also used academic books 
on militias. <b>Reports</b> by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are systematically examined for relevant 
information, as well as other related <b>collections</b> of materials on militias, including the Stanford ‘Mapping 
Militant Organizations Project’ and Wikipedia. 
<br><br>

The research team explores the sources for the term “militias” and specific names of groups that are listed in the Pro-Government Militias Database, using alternative spellings and names where appropriate.
